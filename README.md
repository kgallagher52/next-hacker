## Progressive Web Application

  ```
  We can take our web application and deliver it to a phone so it almost seems like it is a native application, 
  run on your home screen and be able to run it offline.

  ```

  ```
  Service Workers - Are scripts that run in the background of your application to allow caching and give the 
  user a native applicaation filling. We configure these service workers using next.config.js (If you are using Next.js).
  First you need to install this package to help ease the process  instead of writing your own service worker npm i sw-precache-webpack-plugin

  ```
